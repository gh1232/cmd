Thank you.

These are answers to frequently asked questions on channel #bash on the
irc.libera.chat <https://libera.chat/> IRC network. These answers are
contributed by the regular members of the channel (originally heiner,
and then others including greycat and r00t), and by users like you. If
you find something inaccurate or simply misspelled, please feel free to
correct it!

All the information here is presented without any warranty or guarantee

man pages or the GNU info pages as the authoritative references.

BASH <https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BASH> is a BourneShell
<https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BourneShell> compatible shell, which adds
many new features to its ancestor. Most of them are available in the
KornShell <https://mywiki.wooledge.org/KornShell>, too. The answers
given in this FAQ may be slanted toward Bash, or they may be slanted
toward the lowest common denominator Bourne shell, depending on who
wrote the answer. In most cases, an effort is made to provide both a
portable (Bourne) and an efficient (Bash, where appropriate) answer. If
a question is not strictly shell specific, but rather related to Unix,
it may be in the UnixFaq <https://mywiki.wooledge.org/UnixFaq>.

This FAQ assumes a certain level of familiarity with basic shell script
syntax. If you're completely new to Bash or to the Bourne family of
shells, you may wish to start with the BashGuide
<https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide>.

More advanced users may wish to read BashPitfalls
<https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls> and BashProgramming

    1. How can I read a file (data stream, variable) line-by-line
    (and/or field-by-field)?

Don't try to use "for"
<https://mywiki.wooledge.org/DontReadLinesWithFor>. Use a while loop and
the read command. Here is the basic template; there are many variations
to discuss:

<https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/001?action=edit&backto=BashFAQ>


    2. How can I store the return value and/or output of a command in a
    variable?

Well, that depends on whether you want to store the command's /output/
(either stdout, or stdout + stderr) or its /exit status/ (0 to 255, with
0 typically meaning "success").

    3. How can I sort or compare files based on some metadata attribute
    (newest / oldest modification time, size, etc)?

The tempting solution is to use ls to output sorted filenames and
operate on the results using e.g. awk. As usual, the ls approach cannot
be made robust <https://mywiki.wooledge.org/ParsingLs> and should never
be used in scripts due in part to the possibility of arbitrary
characters (including newlines) present in filenames. Therefore, we need
some other way to compare file metadata.

    4. How can I check whether a directory is empty or not? How do I
    check for any *.mpg files, or count how many there are?

In Bash, you can count files safely and easily with the nullglob and
dotglob options (which change the behaviour of globbing
<https://mywiki.wooledge.org/glob>), and an array
<https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/005>:

    5. How can I use array variables?

This answer assumes you have a basic understanding of what arrays /are/.
If you're new to this kind of programming, you may wish to start with
the guide's explanation <https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/Arrays>.
This page is more thorough. See links
<https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/005#See_Also> at the bottom for
more resources.

    6. How can I use variable variables (indirect variables, pointers,
    references) or associative arrays?

This is a complex page, because it's a complex topic. It's been divided
into roughly three parts: associative arrays, evaluating indirect
variables, and assigning indirect variables. There are discussions of
programming issues and concepts scattered throughout.

    9. What is buffering? Or, why does my command line produce no
    output: tail -f logfile | grep 'foo bar' | awk ...

Most standard Unix commands buffer their output when used
non-interactively. This means that they don't write each character (or
even each line) immediately, but instead collect a larger number of
characters (often 4 kilobytes) before printing anything at all. In the
case above, the grep command buffers its output, and therefore awk only
gets its input in large chunks.

    13. How can I concatenate two variables? How do I append a string to
    a variable?

There is no (explicit) concatenation operator for strings (either
literal or variable dereferences) in the shell; you just write them
adjacent to each other:

    16. How can I use a logical AND/OR/NOT in a shell pattern (glob)?

"Globs" <https://mywiki.wooledge.org/glob> are simple patterns that can
be used to match filenames or strings. They're generally not very
powerful. If you need more power, there are a few options available.

    17. How can I group expressions in an if statement, e.g. if (A AND
    B) OR C?

    18. How can I use numbers with leading zeros in a loop, e.g. 01, 02?

As always, there are many different ways to solve the problem, each with
its own advantages and disadvantages. The most important considerations
are which shell you're using, whether the start/end numbers are
constants, and how many times the loop is going to iterate.

    19. How can I split a file into line ranges, e.g. lines 1-10, 11-20,
    21-30?

POSIX specifies the split utility, which can be used for this purpose:

<https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/019?action=edit&backto=BashFAQ>


    20. How can I find and safely handle file names containing newlines,
    spaces or both?

First and foremost, to understand why you're having trouble, read
Arguments <https://mywiki.wooledge.org/Arguments> to get a grasp on how
the shell understands the statements you give it. It is vital that you
grasp this matter well if you're going to be doing anything with the shell.

    21. How can I replace a string with another string in a variable, a
    stream, a file, or in all the files in a directory?

There are a number of techniques for this. Which one to use depends on
many factors, the biggest of which is /what we're editing/. This page
also contains contradictory advice from multiple authors. This is a
deeply /ugly/ topic, and there are no universally right answers (but
plenty of universally /wrong/ ones).

    22. How can I calculate with floating point numbers instead of just
    integers?

    23. I want to launch an interactive shell that has special aliases
    and functions, not the ones in the user's ~/.bashrc.

When starting bash in non-POSIX mode, specify a different start-up file

    24. I set variables in a loop that's in a pipeline. Why do they
    disappear after the loop terminates? Or, why can't I pipe data to read?

In most shells, each command of a pipeline is executed in a separate
SubShell <https://mywiki.wooledge.org/SubShell>. Non-working example:

    25. How can I access positional parameters after $9?

Use ${10} instead of $10. This works for BASH
<https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BASH> and KornShell
<https://mywiki.wooledge.org/KornShell>, but not for older BourneShell
<https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BourneShell> implementations. Another way
to access arbitrary positional parameters after $9 is to use for, e.g.
to get the last parameter:

    26. How can I randomize (shuffle) the order of lines in a file? Or
    select a random line from a file, or select a random file from a
    directory?

To randomize the lines of a file, here is one approach. This one
involves generating a random number, which is prefixed to each line;
then sorting the resulting lines, and removing the numbers.

    27. How can two unrelated processes communicate?

Two unrelated processes cannot use the arguments, the environment or
stdin/stdout to communicate; some form of inter-process communication
(IPC) is required.

    28. How do I determine the location of my script? I want to read
    some config files from the same place.

There are two prime reasons why this issue comes up: either you want to
externalize data or configuration of your script and need a way to find
these external resources, or your script is intended to act upon a
bundle of some sort (eg. a build script), and needs to find the
resources to act upon.

    to underscores, or convert upper-case file names to lower case?

There are a bunch of different ways to do this, depending on which
nonstandard tools you have available. Even with just standard POSIX
tools, you can still perform most of the simple cases. We'll show the
portable tool examples first.

    31. What is the difference between test, [ and [[ ?

[ (aka test) command the and [[ ... ]] test construct are used to
evaluate expressions. [[ ... ]] works only in the Korn shell (where it
originates), Bash, Zsh, and recent versions of Yash and busybox sh (if
enabled at compilation time, and still very limited there especially in
the hush-based variant), and is more powerful; [ and test are POSIX
utilities (generally builtin). POSIX doesn't specify the [[ ... ]]
construct (which has a specific syntax with significant variations
between implementations) though allows shells to treat [[ as a keyword.
Here are some examples:

    42. How can I find out if a process is still running?

The kill command is used to send signals to a running process. As a
convenience function, the signal "0", which does not exist, can be used
to find out if a process is still running:

    43. Why does my crontab job fail? 0 0 * * * some command >
    /var/log/mylog.`date +%Y%m%d`

In many versions of crontab, the percent sign (%) is treated specially,
and therefore must be escaped with backslashes:

    44. How do I create a progress bar? How do I see a progress
    indicator when copying/moving files?

The easiest way to add a progress bar to your own script is to use
dialog --gauge. Here is an example, which relies heavily on BASH
<https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BASH> features:

    45. How can I ensure that only one instance of a script is running
    at a time (mutual exclusion, locking)?

We need some means of /mutual exclusion/. One way is to use a "lock":
any number of processes can try to acquire the lock simultaneously, but
only one of them will succeed.

    47. How can I redirect stderr to a pipe?

A pipe can only carry standard output (stdout) of a program. To pipe
standard error (stderr) through it, you need to redirect stderr to the
same destination as stdout. Optionally you can close stdout or redirect
it to /dev/null to only get stderr. Some sample code:

    49. How can I view periodic updates/appends to a file? (ex: growing
    log file)

tail -f will show you the growing log file. On some systems (e.g.
OpenBSD), this will automatically track a rotated log file to the new
file with the same name (which is usually what you want). To get the
equivalent functionality on GNU systems, use tail -F instead.

    50. I'm trying to put a command in a variable, but the complex cases
    always fail!

Variables hold data. Functions hold code. Don't put code inside
variables! There are many situations in which people try to shove
commands, or command arguments, into variables and then run them. Each
case needs to be handled separately.

    52. How do I convert a file from DOS format to UNIX format (remove
    CRs from CR-LF line terminators)?

Carriage return (CR) characters are used in line ending markers on some
systems. There are three different kinds of line endings in common use:

    53. I have a fancy prompt with colors, and now bash doesn't seem to
    know how wide my terminal is. Lines wrap around incorrectly.


      53.1. Escape the colors with \[ \]

You must put \[ and \] around any non-printing escape sequences in your
prompt. Thus:

    54. How can I tell whether a variable contains a valid number?

First, you have to define what you mean by "number". The most common
case when people ask this seems to be "a non-negative integer, with no
leading + sign". Or in other words, a string of all digits. Other times,
people want to validate a floating-point input, with optional sign and
optional decimal point.

    55. Tell me all about 2>&1 -- what's the difference between 2>&1
    >foo and >foo 2>&1, and when do I use which?

Bash processes all redirections
<https://mywiki.wooledge.org/Redirection> from left to right, in order.
And the order is significant. Moving them around within a command may
change the results of that command.

    56. How can I untar (or unzip) multiple tarballs at once?

As the tar command was originally designed to read from and write to
tape devices (tar - Tape ARchiver), you can specify only filenames to
put inside an archive (write to tape) or to extract out of an archive
(read from tape).

    62. How do I create a temporary file in a secure manner?

There does not appear to be any single command that simply /works/
everywhere. tempfile is not portable. mktemp exists more widely (but
still not ubiquitously), but it may require a -c switch to create the
file in advance; or it may create the file by default and barf if -c is
supplied. Some systems don't have either command (Solaris, POSIX). POSIX
systems are supposed to have m4 which has the ability to create a
temporary file, but some systems may not install m4 by default, or their
implementation of m4 may be missing this feature.

haven't presented the problem clearly
<https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BadQuestions>. Maybe the question you asked

    67. How can I trim leading/trailing white space from one of my

command properly is /always/ preferable to the alternatives below.

    70. How do I convert Unix (epoch) times to human-readable values?

The only sane way to handle time values within a program is to convert
them into a linear scale. You can't store "January 17, 2005 at 5:37 PM"
in a variable and expect to do anything with it....

    71. How do I convert an ASCII character to its decimal (or

environment to be properly configured.

BourneShell <https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BourneShell>. If your code
needs to be portable to that shell as well, sed and expr can often be used.

    80. How can I make an alias that takes an argument?

You can't. Aliases in bash are extremely rudimentary, and not really
suitable to any serious purpose. The bash man page even says so explicitly:

    82. Why is $(...) preferred over `...` (backticks)?

`...` is the legacy syntax for command substitution

very oldest of non-POSIX-compatible Bourne shells
<https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BourneShell>. There are several reasons to
always prefer the $(...) syntax:

    83. How do I determine whether a variable is already defined? Or a
    function?

There are several ways to test these things, depending on the exact
requirements. Most of the time, the desired test is /whether a variable
has a non-empty value/. In this case, we may simply use:

    84. How do I return a string (or large number, or negative number)
    from a function? "return" only lets me give a number from 0 to 255.

Functions in Bash (as well as all the other Bourne-family shells) work
like commands: that is, they only "return" an exit status, which is an
integer from 0 to 255 inclusive. This is intended to be used only for
signaling errors, not for returning the results of computations, or
other data.

that step.

There are several potential ways, most of which are system-specific.
They also depend on precisely /why/ you want the information; in most
cases, there will be some other way to accomplish your real goal
<https://mywiki.wooledge.org/XyProblem>. You don't want to parse ls's
output <https://mywiki.wooledge.org/ParsingLs> if there's any possible
way to avoid doing so.

Sadly, parsing the output of df really is the most reliable way to
determine how full a disk is, on most operating systems. However, please
note that this is a "least bad" answer, not a "best" answer. Parsing any
command-line reporting tool's output in a program is never pretty. The
purpose of this FAQ is to try to describe all the problems this approach

    95. I'm getting "Argument list too long". How can I process a large
    list in chunks?

First, let's review some background material. When a process wants to
run another process, it fork()s a child, and the child calls one of the
exec* family of system calls (e.g. execve()), giving the name or path of
the new process's program file; the name of the new process; the list of
arguments for the new process; and, in some cases, a set of environment
variables. Thus:

    100. How do I do string manipulations in bash?

Bash can do string operations. LOTS of string operations. This is an
introduction to bash string manipulations and related techniques. It
overlaps with the Parameter Expansion
<https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/073> question, but the information
here is presented in a more beginner-friendly manner (we hope).

    101. Common utility functions (warn, die)

(If you were looking for option processing, see BashFAQ/035
<https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/035>.) Bash and sh don't offer a
die builtin command like Perl does, but it's common to use a die
function in scripts. You just have to write one yourself. Most people
who write a die function like to keep it simple. There are two common
varieties: one that only takes a message to print, and one that takes a
message and an exit status value.

    102. How to get the difference between two dates

It's best if you work with timestamps throughout your code, and then
only convert timestamps to human-readable formats for output. If you
must handle human-readable dates as input, then you will need something
that can parse them.

    103. How do I check whether my file was modified in a certain month
    or date range?

Doing date-related math in Bash is hard because Bash has no builtins in
place for doing math with dates or getting metadata such as modification
time from files.

<https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/103?action=edit&backto=BashFAQ>


    104. Why doesn't foo=bar echo "$foo" print bar?

This is subtle, and has to do with the exact order in which the
BashParser <https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashParser> performs each step.

[BashFAQ/104] <https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/104>[edit]
<https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/104?action=edit&backto=BashFAQ>


    105. Why doesn't set -e (or set -o errexit, or trap ERR) do what I
    expected?

set -e was an attempt to add "automatic error detection" to the shell.
Its goal was to cause the shell to abort any time an error occurred, so
you don't have to put || exit 1 after each important command. This does
not work well in practice.

    106. Logging! I want to send all of my script's output to a log
    file. But I want to do it from inside the script. And I want to see
    it on the terminal too!

Normally, if you want to run a script and send its output to a logfile,
you'd simply use Redirection <https://mywiki.wooledge.org/Redirection>:
myscript >log 2>&1. Or to see the output on the screen /and also/
redirect to a file: myscript 2>&1 | tee log (or better still, run your
script within the script(1) command if your system has it). If you want
to insert commands /into/ a script that cause it to do this kind of
logging internally, without altering your invocation, then it gets
trickier.

<https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/106?action=edit&backto=BashFAQ>


    107. How do I add a timestamp to every line of a stream?

Adding timestamps to a stream is a challenge, because there aren't any
standard tools to do it. You either have to install something
specifically for it (e.g. ts from moreutils
<http://joeyh.name/code/moreutils/>, or multilog
<http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/multilog.html> from daemontools), or write
a filter in some programming language. Ideally, you *do not want* to
fork a date(1) command for every line of input that you're logging,
because it's too slow. You want to use builtins. Older versions of bash
/cannot do this/. You need at least Bash 4.2
<https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/061> for the printf %(...)T option.
Otherwise, you could write something in Perl, Python, Tcl, etc. to read
lines and write them out with timestamps.

    108. How do I wait for several spawned processes?

There are numerous ways to do this, but all of them are either limited
by the available tools. I have come up with the following solutions.

    109. How can I tell whether my script was sourced (dotted in) or
    executed?

There seem to be two reasons why people ask this: either they're trying
to detect user errors and provide a friendly message, or they're Python
programmers who want to use one of Python's most idiosyncratic features
in bash.

    110. How do I copy a file to a remote system, and specify a remote
    name which may contain spaces?

All of the common tools for copying files to a remote system (ssh, scp,
rsync) send the filename as part of a shell command, which the remote
system interprets. This makes the issue extremely complex, because the
remote shell will often mangle the filename. There are at least three
ways to deal with the problem: NFS, careful encoding of the filename, or
submission of the filename as part of the data stream.

    111. What is the Shellshock vulnerability in Bash?

"Shellshock" refers to two remotely-exploitable vulnerabilities in Bash,
discovered in September 2014. The first vulnerability exploits the
mechanism that Bash used to export and import functions, and allowed
arbitrary command execution. The second vulnerability exploits a parser
bug and allowed local files to be created.

    112. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using set -u (or
    set -o nounset)?

Bash (like all other Bourne shell derivatives) has a feature activated
by the command set -u (or set -o nounset). When this feature is in
effect, any command which attempts to expand an unset variable will
cause a *fatal* error (the shell immediately exits, unless it is
interactive).

    113. How do I extract data from an HTML or XML file?

*Do not* attempt this with sed, awk, grep, and so on (it leads to
undesired results <http://xrl.us/p0ny>). In many cases, your best option
is to write in a language that has support for XML data. If you have to
use a shell script, there are a few HTML- and XML-specific tools
available to parse these files for you.

<https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/113?action=edit&backto=BashFAQ>


    114. How do I operate on IP addresses and netmasks?

IPv4 addresses are 32-bit unsigned integers. The "dotted quad" notation
(192.168.1.2) is only one means of representing such an address. When
applying netmasks, it's easier if we first convert the dotted quad
format into a plain integer.

    115. How do I make a menu?

Some people like to use select because it's simple. If your own needs
are extremely simple, then this may be sufficient for you. If you want
your own look and feel, you can simply write a menu yourself. There is
also dialog <https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/040>, which we won't
cover on this page.

    116. I have two files. The first one contains bad IP addresses (plus
    other fields). I want to remove all of these bad addresses from a
    second file.

This is a more generalized form of one of the questions from FAQ 36
<https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/036> (where the entire line is
significant in each file). In this form, we're only using /part/ of each
line as a key. We're going to show how to approach this kind of problem
using an associative array <https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/006>.

<https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/116?action=edit&backto=BashFAQ>


    117. I have a pipeline where a long-running command feeds into a
    filter. If the filter finds "foo", I want the long-running command
    to die.

In general this is not possible, because sibling processes (two children
of the same parent) do not have any knowledge of each other. But
consider the following example and answers:

[BashFAQ/117] <https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/117>[edit]
<https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/117?action=edit&backto=BashFAQ>


    118. How do I print the contents of an array in reverse order, or
    reverse an array?

First note that the concept of /order/ applies only to indexed arrays
<https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/005>, not associative arrays. The
answers would be simpler if there were no sparse arrays, but bash's
arrays /can/ be sparse (non-sequential indices). So we have to introduce
an extra step.

<https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/118?action=edit&backto=BashFAQ>


    119. What's the difference between "cmd < file" and "cat file |
    cmd"? What is a UUOC?

Most of the time, these commands do the same thing, but the second one
is less efficient, and it also breaks in certain rare circumstances.

<https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/119?action=edit&backto=BashFAQ>


    120. How can I find out where this strange variable in my
    interactive shell came from?

Some variables are set by programs that run before bash, and this FAQ
can't help you with those. For the variables that are set by bash
reading a dot file <https://mywiki.wooledge.org/DotFiles>, if you are
/not/ root, you can use bash's trace mode:

<https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/120?action=edit&backto=BashFAQ>


    121. What does value too great for base mean? (Octal values in
    arithmetic.)

When reading numbers from files or commands and then performing
arithmetic with them, leading zeroes may cause a problem:

$ echo $((09))
bash: 09: value too great for base (error token is "09")
