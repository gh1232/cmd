    Background<#background>


      Which Shell to Use<#which-shell-to-use>

Bash is the only shell scripting language permitted for executables.

Executables must start with |#!/bin/bash| and a minimum number of flags.
Use |set| to set shell options so that calling your script as |bash
script_name| does not break its functionality.

Restricting all executable shell scripts to /bash/ gives us a consistent
shell language that’s installed on all our machines.

The only exception to this is where you’re forced to by whatever you’re
coding for. One example of this is Solaris SVR4 packages which require
plain Bourne shell for any scripts.


      When to use Shell<#when-to-use-shell>

Shell should only be used for small utilities or simple wrapper scripts.

While shell scripting isn’t a development language, it is used for
writing various utility scripts throughout Google. This style guide is
more a recognition of its use rather than a suggestion that it be used
for widespread deployment.

Some guidelines:

  * If you’re mostly calling other utilities and are doing relatively
    little data manipulation, shell is an acceptable choice for the task.
  * If performance matters, use something other than shell.
  * If you are writing a script that is more than 100 lines long, or
    that uses non-straightforward control flow logic, you should rewrite
    it in a more structured language /now/. Bear in mind that scripts
    grow. Rewrite your script early to avoid a more time-consuming
    rewrite at a later date.
  * When assessing the complexity of your code (e.g. to decide whether
    to switch languages) consider whether the code is easily
    maintainable by people other than its author.


    Shell Files and Interpreter
    Invocation<#shell-files-and-interpreter-invocation>


      File Extensions<#file-extensions>

Executables should have no extension (strongly preferred) or a |.sh|
extension. Libraries must have a |.sh| extension and should not be
executable.

It is not necessary to know what language a program is written in when
executing it and shell doesn’t require an extension so we prefer not to
use one for executables.

However, for libraries it’s important to know what language it is and
sometimes there’s a need to have similar libraries in different
languages. This allows library files with identical purposes but
different languages to be identically named except for the
language-specific suffix.


      SUID/SGID<#suidsgid>

SUID and SGID are /forbidden/ on shell scripts.

There are too many security issues with shell that make it nearly
impossible to secure sufficiently to allow SUID/SGID. While bash does
make it difficult to run SUID, it’s still possible on some platforms
which is why we’re being explicit about banning it.

Use |sudo| to provide elevated access if you need it.


    Environment<#environment>


      STDOUT vs STDERR<#stdout-vs-stderr>

All error messages should go to |STDERR|.

This makes it easier to separate normal status from actual issues.

A function to print out error messages along with other status
information is recommended.

|err() {
  echo "[$(date +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z')]: $*" >&2
}

if ! do_something; then
  err "Unable to do_something"
  exit 1
fi
|


    Comments<#comments>


      File Header<#file-header>

Start each file with a description of its contents.

Every file must have a top-level comment including a brief overview of
its contents. A copyright notice and author information are optional.

Example:

|#!/bin/bash
#
# Perform hot backups of Oracle databases.
|


      Function Comments<#function-comments>

Any function that is not both obvious and short must be commented. Any
function in a library must be commented regardless of length or complexity.

It should be possible for someone else to learn how to use your program
or to use a function in your library by reading the comments (and
self-help, if provided) without reading the code.

All function comments should describe the intended API behaviour using:

  * Description of the function.
  * Globals: List of global variables used and modified.
  * Arguments: Arguments taken.
  * Outputs: Output to STDOUT or STDERR.
  * Returns: Returned values other than the default exit status of the
    last command run.

Example:

|#######################################
# Cleanup files from the backup directory.
# Globals:
#   BACKUP_DIR
#   ORACLE_SID
# Arguments:
#   None
#######################################
function cleanup() {
  …
}

#######################################
# Get configuration directory.
# Globals:
#   SOMEDIR
# Arguments:
#   None
# Outputs:
#   Writes location to stdout
#######################################
function get_dir() {
  echo "${SOMEDIR}"
}

#######################################
# Delete a file in a sophisticated manner.
# Arguments:
#   File to delete, a path.
# Returns:
#   0 if thing was deleted, non-zero on error.
#######################################
function del_thing() {
  rm "$1"
}
|


      Implementation Comments<#implementation-comments>

Comment tricky, non-obvious, interesting or important parts of your code.

This follows general Google coding comment practice. Don’t comment
everything. If there’s a complex algorithm or you’re doing something out
of the ordinary, put a short comment in.


      TODO Comments<#todo-comments>

Use TODO comments for code that is temporary, a short-term solution, or
good-enough but not perfect.

This matches the convention in the C++ Guide
<https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#TODO_Comments>.

|TODO|s should include the string |TODO| in all caps, followed by the
name, e-mail address, or other identifier of the person with the best
context about the problem referenced by the |TODO|. The main purpose is
to have a consistent |TODO| that can be searched to find out how to get
more details upon request. A |TODO| is not a commitment that the person
referenced will fix the problem. Thus when you create a |TODO| , it is
almost always your name that is given.

Examples:

|# TODO(mrmonkey): Handle the unlikely edge cases (bug ####)
|


    Formatting<#formatting>

While you should follow the style that’s already there for files that
you’re modifying, the following are required for any new code.


      Indentation<#indentation>

Indent 2 spaces. No tabs.

Use blank lines between blocks to improve readability. Indentation is
two spaces. Whatever you do, don’t use tabs. For existing files, stay
faithful to the existing indentation.


      Line Length and Long Strings<#line-length-and-long-strings>

Maximum line length is 80 characters.

If you have to write strings that are longer than 80 characters, this
should be done with a here document or an embedded newline if possible.
Literal strings that have to be longer than 80 chars and can’t sensibly
be split are ok, but it’s strongly preferred to find a way to make it
shorter.

|# DO use 'here document's
cat <<END
I am an exceptionally long
string.
END

# Embedded newlines are ok too
long_string="I am an exceptionally
long string."
|


      Pipelines<#pipelines>

Pipelines should be split one per line if they don’t all fit on one line.

If a pipeline all fits on one line, it should be on one line.

If not, it should be split at one pipe segment per line with the pipe on
the newline and a 2 space indent for the next section of the pipe. This
applies to a chain of commands combined using ||| as well as to logical
compounds using |||| and |&&|.

|# All fits on one line
command1 | command2

# Long commands
command1 \
  | command2 \
  | command3 \
  | command4
|


      Loops<#loops>

Put |; do| and |; then| on the same line as the |while|, |for| or |if|.

Loops in shell are a bit different, but we follow the same principles as
with braces when declaring functions. That is: |; then| and |; do|
should be on the same line as the if/for/while. |else| should be on its
own line and closing statements should be on their own line vertically
aligned with the opening statement.

Example:

|# If inside a function, consider declaring the loop variable as
# a local to avoid it leaking into the global environment:
# local dir
for dir in "${dirs_to_cleanup[@]}"; do
  if [[ -d "${dir}/${ORACLE_SID}" ]]; then
    log_date "Cleaning up old files in ${dir}/${ORACLE_SID}"
    rm "${dir}/${ORACLE_SID}/"*
    if (( $? != 0 )); then
      error_message
    fi
  else
    mkdir -p "${dir}/${ORACLE_SID}"
    if (( $? != 0 )); then
      error_message
    fi
  fi
done
|


      Case statement<#case-statement>

  * Indent alternatives by 2 spaces.
  * A one-line alternative needs a space after the close parenthesis of
    the pattern and before the |;;|.
  * Long or multi-command alternatives should be split over multiple
    lines with the pattern, actions, and |;;| on separate lines.

The matching expressions are indented one level from the |case| and
|esac|. Multiline actions are indented another level. In general, there
is no need to quote match expressions. Pattern expressions should not be
preceded by an open parenthesis. Avoid the |;&| and |;;&| notations.

|case "${expression}" in
  a)
    variable="…"
    some_command "${variable}" "${other_expr}" …
    ;;
  absolute)
    actions="relative"
    another_command "${actions}" "${other_expr}" …
    ;;
  *)
    error "Unexpected expression '${expression}'"
    ;;
esac
|

Simple commands may be put on the same line as the pattern /and/ |;;| as
long as the expression remains readable. This is often appropriate for
single-letter option processing. When the actions don’t fit on a single
line, put the pattern on a line on its own, then the actions, then |;;|
also on a line of its own. When on the same line as the actions, use a
space after the close parenthesis of the pattern and another before the
|;;|.

|verbose='false'
aflag=''
bflag=''
files=''
while getopts 'abf:v' flag; do
  case "${flag}" in
    a) aflag='true' ;;
    b) bflag='true' ;;
    f) files="${OPTARG}" ;;
    v) verbose='true' ;;
    *) error "Unexpected option ${flag}" ;;
  esac
done
|


      Variable expansion<#variable-expansion>

In order of precedence: Stay consistent with what you find; quote your
variables; prefer |"${var}"| over |"$var"|.

These are strongly recommended guidelines but not mandatory regulation.
Nonetheless, the fact that it’s a recommendation and not mandatory
doesn’t mean it should be taken lightly or downplayed.

They are listed in order of precedence.

  * Stay consistent with what you find for existing code.
  * Quote variables, see Quoting section below <#quoting>.
  *

    Don’t brace-delimit single character shell specials / positional
    parameters, unless strictly necessary or avoiding deep confusion.

    Prefer brace-delimiting all other variables.

    |# Section of *recommended* cases.

    # Preferred style for 'special' variables:
    echo "Positional: $1" "$5" "$3"
    echo "Specials: !=$!, -=$-, _=$_. ?=$?, #=$# *=$* @=$@ \$=$$ …"

    # Braces necessary:
    echo "many parameters: ${10}"

    # Braces avoiding confusion:
    # Output is "a0b0c0"
    set -- a b c
    echo "${1}0${2}0${3}0"

    # Preferred style for other variables:
    echo "PATH=${PATH}, PWD=${PWD}, mine=${some_var}"
    while read -r f; do
      echo "file=${f}"
    done < <(find /tmp)
    |

    |# Section of *discouraged* cases

    # Unquoted vars, unbraced vars, brace-delimited single letter
    # shell specials.
    echo a=$avar "b=$bvar" "PID=${$}" "${1}"

    # Confusing use: this is expanded as "${1}0${2}0${3}0",
    # not "${10}${20}${30}
    set -- a b c
    echo "$10$20$30"
    |

NOTE: Using braces in |${var}| is /not/ a form of quoting. “Double
quotes” must be used /as well/.


      Quoting<#quoting>

  * Always quote strings containing variables, command substitutions,
    spaces or shell meta characters, unless careful unquoted expansion
    is required or it’s a shell-internal integer (see next point).
  * Use arrays for safe quoting of lists of elements, especially
    command-line flags. See Arrays <#arrays> below.
  * Optionally quote shell-internal, readonly special variables that are
    defined to be integers: |$?|, |$#|, |$$|, |$!| (man bash). Prefer
    quoting of “named” internal integer variables, e.g. PPID etc for
    consistency.
  * Prefer quoting strings that are “words” (as opposed to command
    options or path names).
  * Never quote /literal/ integers.
  * Be aware of the quoting rules for pattern matches in |[[ … ]]|. See
    the Test, |[ … ]|, and |[[ … ]]| <#tests> section below.
  * Use |"$@"| unless you have a specific reason to use |$*|, such as
    simply appending the arguments to a string in a message or log.

|# 'Single' quotes indicate that no substitution is desired.
# "Double" quotes indicate that substitution is required/tolerated.

# Simple examples

# "quote command substitutions"
# Note that quotes nested inside "$()" don't need escaping.
flag="$(some_command and its args "$@" 'quoted separately')"

# "quote variables"
echo "${flag}"

# Use arrays with quoted expansion for lists.
declare -a FLAGS
FLAGS=( --foo --bar='baz' )
readonly FLAGS
mybinary "${FLAGS[@]}"

# It's ok to not quote internal integer variables.
if (( $# > 3 )); then
  echo "ppid=${PPID}"
fi

# "never quote literal integers"
value=32
# "quote command substitutions", even when you expect integers
number="$(generate_number)"

# "prefer quoting words", not compulsory
readonly USE_INTEGER='true'

# "quote shell meta characters"
echo 'Hello stranger, and well met. Earn lots of $$$'
echo "Process $$: Done making \$\$\$."

# "command options or path names"
# ($1 is assumed to contain a value here)
grep -li Hugo /dev/null "$1"

# Less simple examples
# "quote variables, unless proven false": ccs might be empty
git send-email --to "${reviewers}" ${ccs:+"--cc" "${ccs}"}

# Positional parameter precautions: $1 might be unset
# Single quotes leave regex as-is.
grep -cP '([Ss]pecial|\|?characters*)$' ${1:+"$1"}

# For passing on arguments,
# "$@" is right almost every time, and
# $* is wrong almost every time:
#
# * $* and $@ will split on spaces, clobbering up arguments
#   that contain spaces and dropping empty strings;
# * "$@" will retain arguments as-is, so no args
#   provided will result in no args being passed on;
#   This is in most cases what you want to use for passing
#   on arguments.
# * "$*" expands to one argument, with all args joined
#   by (usually) spaces,
#   so no args provided will result in one empty string
#   being passed on.
# (Consult `man bash` for the nit-grits ;-)

(set -- 1 "2 two" "3 three tres"; echo $#; set -- "$*"; echo "$#, $@")
(set -- 1 "2 two" "3 three tres"; echo $#; set -- "$@"; echo "$#, $@")

    Features and Bugs<#features-and-bugs>


      ShellCheck<#shellcheck>

The ShellCheck project <https://www.shellcheck.net/> identifies common
bugs and warnings for your shell scripts. It is recommended for all
scripts, large or small.


      Command Substitution<#command-substitution>

Use |$(command)| instead of backticks.

Nested backticks require escaping the inner ones with |\ |. The
|$(command)| format doesn’t change when nested and is easier to read.

Example:

|# This is preferred:
var="$(command "$(command1)")"
|

|# This is not:
var="`command \`command1\``"
|


      Test, |[ … ]|, and |[[ … ]]|<#test----and--->

|[[ … ]]| is preferred over |[ … ]|, |test| and |/usr/bin/[|.

|[[ … ]]| reduces errors as no pathname expansion or word splitting
takes place between |[[| and |]]|. In addition, |[[ … ]]| allows for
regular expression matching, while |[ … ]| does not.

|# This ensures the string on the left is made up of characters in
# the alnum character class followed by the string name.
# Note that the RHS should not be quoted here.
if [[ "filename" =~ ^[[:alnum:]]+name ]]; then
  echo "Match"
fi

# This matches the exact pattern "f*" (Does not match in this case)
if [[ "filename" == "f*" ]]; then
  echo "Match"
fi
|

|# This gives a "too many arguments" error as f* is expanded to the
# contents of the current directory
if [ "filename" == f* ]; then
  echo "Match"
fi
|

For the gory details, see E14 at http://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/FAQ


      Testing Strings<#testing-strings>

Use quotes rather than filler characters where possible.

Bash is smart enough to deal with an empty string in a test. So, given
that the code is much easier to read, use tests for empty/non-empty
strings or empty strings rather than filler characters.

|# Do this:
if [[ "${my_var}" == "some_string" ]]; then
  do_something
fi

# -z (string length is zero) and -n (string length is not zero) are
# preferred over testing for an empty string
if [[ -z "${my_var}" ]]; then
  do_something
fi

# This is OK (ensure quotes on the empty side), but not preferred:
if [[ "${my_var}" == "" ]]; then
  do_something
fi
|

|# Not this:
if [[ "${my_var}X" == "some_stringX" ]]; then
  do_something
fi
|

To avoid confusion about what you’re testing for, explicitly use |-z| or
|-n|.

|# Use this
if [[ -n "${my_var}" ]]; then
  do_something
fi
|

|# Instead of this
if [[ "${my_var}" ]]; then
  do_something
fi
|

For clarity, use |==| for equality rather than |=| even though both
work. The former encourages the use of |[[| and the latter can be
confused with an assignment. However, be careful when using |<| and |>|
in |[[ … ]]| which performs a lexicographical comparison. Use |(( … ))|
or |-lt| and |-gt| for numerical comparison.

|# Use this
if [[ "${my_var}" == "val" ]]; then
  do_something
fi

if (( my_var > 3 )); then
  do_something
fi

if [[ "${my_var}" -gt 3 ]]; then
  do_something
fi
|

|# Instead of this
if [[ "${my_var}" = "val" ]]; then
  do_something
fi

# Probably unintended lexicographical comparison.
if [[ "${my_var}" > 3 ]]; then
  # True for 4, false for 22.
  do_something
fi
|


      Wildcard Expansion of Filenames<#wildcard-expansion-of-filenames>

Use an explicit path when doing wildcard expansion of filenames.

As filenames can begin with a |-|, it’s a lot safer to expand wildcards
with |./*| instead of |*|.

|# Here's the contents of the directory:
# -f  -r  somedir  somefile

# Incorrectly deletes almost everything in the directory by force
psa@bilby$ rm -v *
removed directory: `somedir'
removed `somefile'
|

|# As opposed to:
psa@bilby$ rm -v ./*
removed `./-f'
removed `./-r'
rm: cannot remove `./somedir': Is a directory
removed `./somefile'
|


      Eval<#eval>

|eval| should be avoided.

Eval munges the input when used for assignment to variables and can set
variables without making it possible to check what those variables were.

|# What does this set?
# Did it succeed? In part or whole?
eval $(set_my_variables)

# What happens if one of the returned values has a space in it?
variable="$(eval some_function)"
|


      Arrays<#arrays>

Bash arrays should be used to store lists of elements, to avoid quoting
complications. This particularly applies to argument lists. Arrays
should not be used to facilitate more complex data structures (see When
to use Shell <#when-to-use-shell> above).

Arrays store an ordered collection of strings, and can be safely
expanded into individual elements for a command or loop.

Using a single string for multiple command arguments should be avoided,
as it inevitably leads to authors using |eval| or trying to nest quotes
inside the string, which does not give reliable or readable results and
leads to needless complexity.

|# An array is assigned using parentheses, and can be appended to
# with +=( … ).
declare -a flags
flags=(--foo --bar='baz')
flags+=(--greeting="Hello ${name}")
mybinary "${flags[@]}"
|

|# Don’t use strings for sequences.
flags='--foo --bar=baz'
flags+=' --greeting="Hello world"'  # This won’t work as intended.
mybinary ${flags}
|

|# Command expansions return single strings, not arrays. Avoid
# unquoted expansion in array assignments because it won’t
# work correctly if the command output contains special
# characters or whitespace.

# This expands the listing output into a string, then does special keyword
# expansion, and then whitespace splitting.  Only then is it turned into a
# list of words.  The ls command may also change behavior based on the user's
# active environment!
declare -a files=($(ls /directory))

# The get_arguments writes everything to STDOUT, but then goes through the
# same expansion process above before turning into a list of arguments.
mybinary $(get_arguments)
|


        Arrays Pros<#arrays-pros>

  * Using Arrays allows lists of things without confusing quoting
    semantics. Conversely, not using arrays leads to misguided attempts
    to nest quoting inside a string.
  * Arrays make it possible to safely store sequences/lists of arbitrary
    strings, including strings containing whitespace.


        Arrays Cons<#arrays-cons>

Using arrays can risk a script’s complexity growing.


        Arrays Decision<#arrays-decision>

Arrays should be used to safely create and pass around lists. In
particular, when building a set of command arguments, use arrays to
avoid confusing quoting issues. Use quoted expansion – |"${array[@]}"| –
to access arrays. However, if more advanced data manipulation is
required, shell scripting should be avoided altogether; see above
<#when-to-use-shell>.


      Pipes to While<#pipes-to-while>

Use process substitution or the |readarray| builtin (bash4+) in
preference to piping to |while|. Pipes create a subshell, so any
variables modified within a pipeline do not propagate to the parent shell.

The implicit subshell in a pipe to |while| can introduce subtle bugs
that are hard to track down.

|last_line='NULL'
your_command | while read -r line; do
  if [[ -n "${line}" ]]; then
    last_line="${line}"
  fi
done

# This will always output 'NULL'!
echo "${last_line}"
|

Using process substitution also creates a subshell. However, it allows
redirecting from a subshell to a |while| without putting the |while| (or
any other command) in a subshell.

|last_line='NULL'
while read line; do
  if [[ -n "${line}" ]]; then
    last_line="${line}"
  fi
done < <(your_command)

# This will output the last non-empty line from your_command
echo "${last_line}"
|

Alternatively, use the |readarray| builtin to read the file into an
array, then loop over the array’s contents. Notice that (for the same
reason as above) you need to use a process substitution with |readarray|
rather than a pipe, but with the advantage that the input generation for
the loop is located before it, rather than after.

|last_line='NULL'
readarray -t lines < <(your_command)
for line in "${lines[@]}"; do
  if [[ -n "${line}" ]]; then
    last_line="${line}"
  fi
done
echo "${last_line}"
|

    Note: Be cautious using a for-loop to iterate over output, as in
    |for var in $(...)|, as the output is split by whitespace, not by
    line. Sometimes you will know this is safe because the output can’t
    contain any unexpected whitespace, but where this isn’t obvious or
    doesn’t improve readability (such as a long command inside
    |$(...)|), a |while read| loop or |readarray| is often safer and
    clearer.


      Arithmetic<#arithmetic>

Always use |(( … ))| or |$(( … ))| rather than |let| or |$[ … ]| or |expr|.

Never use the |$[ … ]| syntax, the |expr| command, or the |let| built-in.

|<| and |>| don’t perform numerical comparison inside |[[ … ]]|
expressions (they perform lexicographical comparisons instead; see
Testing Strings <#testing-strings>). For preference, don’t use |[[ … ]]|
/at all/ for numeric comparisons, use |(( … ))| instead.

It is recommended to avoid using |(( … ))| as a standalone statement,
and otherwise be wary of its expression evaluating to zero

  * particularly with |set -e| enabled. For example, |set -e; i=0; ((
    i++ ))| will cause the shell to exit.

|# Simple calculation used as text - note the use of $(( … )) within
# a string.
echo "$(( 2 + 2 )) is 4"

# When performing arithmetic comparisons for testing
if (( a < b )); then
  …
fi

# Some calculation assigned to a variable.
(( i = 10 * j + 400 ))
|

|# This form is non-portable and deprecated
i=$[2 * 10]

# Despite appearances, 'let' isn't one of the declarative keywords,
# so unquoted assignments are subject to globbing wordsplitting.
# For the sake of simplicity, avoid 'let' and use (( … ))
let i="2 + 2"

# The expr utility is an external program and not a shell builtin.
i=$( expr 4 + 4 )

# Quoting can be error prone when using expr too.
i=$( expr 4 '*' 4 )
|

Stylistic considerations aside, the shell’s built-in arithmetic is many
times faster than |expr|.

When using variables, the |${var}| (and |$var|) forms are not required
within |$(( … ))|. The shell knows to look up |var| for you, and
omitting the |${…}| leads to cleaner code. This is slightly contrary to
the previous rule about always using braces, so this is a recommendation
only.

|# N.B.: Remember to declare your variables as integers when
# possible, and to prefer local variables over globals.
local -i hundred=$(( 10 * 10 ))
declare -i five=$(( 10 / 2 ))

# Increment the variable "i" by three.
# Note that:
#  - We do not write ${i} or $i.
#  - We put a space after the (( and before the )).
(( i += 3 ))

# To decrement the variable "i" by five:
(( i -= 5 ))

# Do some complicated computations.
# Note that normal arithmetic operator precedence is observed.
hr=2
min=5
sec=30
echo $(( hr * 3600 + min * 60 + sec )) # prints 7530 as expected

    Naming Conventions<#naming-conventions>


      Function Names<#function-names>

Lower-case, with underscores to separate words. Separate libraries with
|::|. Parentheses are required after the function name. The keyword
|function| is optional, but must be used consistently throughout a project.

If you’re writing single functions, use lowercase and separate words
with underscore. If you’re writing a package, separate package names
with |::|. Braces must be on the same line as the function name (as with
other languages at Google) and no space between the function name and
the parenthesis.

|# Single function
my_func() {
  …
}

# Part of a package
mypackage::my_func() {
  …
}
|

The |function| keyword is extraneous when “()” is present after the
function name, but enhances quick identification of functions.


      Variable Names<#variable-names>

As for function names.

Variables names for loops should be similarly named for any variable
you’re looping through.

|for zone in "${zones[@]}"; do
  something_with "${zone}"
done
|


      Constants and Environment Variable
      Names<#constants-and-environment-variable-names>

All caps, separated with underscores, declared at the top of the file.

Constants and anything exported to the environment should be capitalized.

|# Constant
readonly PATH_TO_FILES='/some/path'

# Both constant and environment
declare -xr ORACLE_SID='PROD'
|

Some things become constant at their first setting (for example, via
getopts). Thus, it’s OK to set a constant in getopts or based on a
condition, but it should be made readonly immediately afterwards. For
the sake of clarity |readonly| or |export| is recommended instead of the
equivalent |declare| commands.

|VERBOSE='false'
while getopts 'v' flag; do
  case "${flag}" in
    v) VERBOSE='true' ;;
  esac
done
readonly VERBOSE
|


      Source Filenames<#source-filenames>

Lowercase, with underscores to separate words if desired.

This is for consistency with other code styles in Google: |maketemplate|
or |make_template| but not |make-template|.


      Read-only Variables<#read-only-variables>

Use |readonly| or |declare -r| to ensure they’re read only.

As globals are widely used in shell, it’s important to catch errors when
working with them. When you declare a variable that is meant to be
read-only, make this explicit.

|zip_version="$(dpkg --status zip | grep Version: | cut -d ' ' -f 2)"
if [[ -z "${zip_version}" ]]; then
  error_message
else
  readonly zip_version
fi
|


      Use Local Variables<#use-local-variables>

Declare function-specific variables with |local|. Declaration and
assignment should be on different lines.

Ensure that local variables are only seen inside a function and its
children by using |local| when declaring them. This avoids polluting the
global name space and inadvertently setting variables that may have
significance outside the function.

Declaration and assignment must be separate statements when the
assignment value is provided by a command substitution; as the |local|
builtin does not propagate the exit code from the command substitution.

|my_func2() {
  local name="$1"

  # Separate lines for declaration and assignment:
  local my_var
  my_var="$(my_func)"
  (( $? == 0 )) || return

  …
}
|

|my_func2() {
  # DO NOT do this:
  # $? will always be zero, as it contains the exit code of 'local', not my_func
  local my_var="$(my_func)"
  (( $? == 0 )) || return

  …
}
|


      Function Location<#function-location>

Put all functions together in the file just below constants. Don’t hide
executable code between functions. Doing so makes the code difficult to
follow and results in nasty surprises when debugging.

If you’ve got functions, put them all together near the top of the file.
Only includes, |set| statements and setting constants may be done before
declaring functions.


      main<#main>

A function called |main| is required for scripts long enough to contain
at least one other function.

In order to easily find the start of the program, put the main program
in a function called |main| as the bottom most function. This provides
consistency with the rest of the code base as well as allowing you to
define more variables as |local| (which can’t be done if the main code
is not a function). The last non-comment line in the file should be a
call to |main|:

|main "$@"
|

Obviously, for short scripts where it’s just a linear flow, |main| is
overkill and so is not required.


    Calling Commands<#calling-commands>


      Checking Return Values<#checking-return-values>

Always check return values and give informative return values.

For unpiped commands, use |$?| or check directly via an |if| statement
to keep it simple.

Example:

|if ! mv "${file_list[@]}" "${dest_dir}/"; then
  echo "Unable to move ${file_list[*]} to ${dest_dir}" >&2
  exit 1
fi

# Or
mv "${file_list[@]}" "${dest_dir}/"
if (( $? != 0 )); then
  echo "Unable to move ${file_list[*]} to ${dest_dir}" >&2
  exit 1
fi
|

Bash also has the |PIPESTATUS| variable that allows checking of the
return code from all parts of a pipe. If it’s only necessary to check
success or failure of the whole pipe, then the following is acceptable:

|tar -cf - ./* | ( cd "${dir}" && tar -xf - )
if (( PIPESTATUS[0] != 0 || PIPESTATUS[1] != 0 )); then
  echo "Unable to tar files to ${dir}" >&2
fi
|

However, as |PIPESTATUS| will be overwritten as soon as you do any other
command, if you need to act differently on errors based on where it
happened in the pipe, you’ll need to assign |PIPESTATUS| to another
variable immediately after running the command (don’t forget that |[| is
a command and will wipe out |PIPESTATUS|).

|tar -cf - ./* | ( cd "${DIR}" && tar -xf - )
return_codes=( "${PIPESTATUS[@]}" )
if (( return_codes[0] != 0 )); then
  do_something
fi
if (( return_codes[1] != 0 )); then
  do_something_else
fi
|


      Builtin Commands vs. External
      Commands<#builtin-commands-vs-external-commands>

Given the choice between invoking a shell builtin and invoking a
separate process, choose the builtin.

We prefer the use of builtins such as the /Parameter Expansion/
functions in |bash(1)| as it’s more robust and portable (especially when
compared to things like |sed|).

Examples:

|# Prefer this:
addition=$(( X + Y ))
substitution="${string/#foo/bar}"
|

|# Instead of this:
addition="$(expr "${X}" + "${Y}")"
substitution="$(echo "${string}" | sed -e 's/^foo/bar/')"
|


    Conclusion<#conclusion>

Use common sense and /BE CONSISTENT/.
