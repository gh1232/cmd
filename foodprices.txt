Omega-3 eggs are produced from hens that have been fed a flax-based diet. They provide an additional source of omega-3 fatty acids and can be used in the same ways as regular eggs. Crack the thin, protective shell against the edge of a bowl (with one hand, if you want to impress your friends) and use the yolk and egg white inside for your favourite breakfast recipes and desserts.

Hass avocados have a pebbly skin that turns from dark green to near black when ripe. Cut lengthwise, twist to separate the halves, and scoop out the creamy, pale green flesh for guacamole (lemon juice will keep the flesh from discolouring) and smoothies, or add sliced avocado to salad or a BLT sandwich.
