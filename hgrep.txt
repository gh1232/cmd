    grep - the basics <https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Grep.html#toc-uh-0>

I assume you have (or will soon) read the section on regular
expressions. /Grep/ uses regular expressions, and most of the power
comes from their flexibility. I will only use simple examples in this
section, so you understand the essentials of /grep/. Real mastery comes
after mastering regular expressions.


    How did grep get it's name?
    <https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Grep.html#toc-uh-1>

The name /grep/ comes from a command used in one of the early Unix
editors. The command searched for a regular expression, and printed it
out. As an example, if you wanted to search for the string "junk," the
command to print the first line containing the word was "/junk/p" and
the command to print all lines that contains the word was "g/junk/p."
The "g" was an abbreviation for "global search."

This feature was used so much, that somebody decided to make it easier
to use, smaller, and faster by creating a smaller program that only did
this global search for regular expressions, and print. The called it
/grep/, which was short for "g//regular expression//p," or "g/re/p." You
may see similar commands today in /vi/ and /sed/.


    The Simple Example <https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Grep.html#toc-uh-2>

Most people first use /grep/ as a way to search the contents of their
files. If you wanted to find the file that contained the password to
another computer, you could execute

    grep password *

All lines in all files that contain this word are printed out. The
output might be this:

    notes: password for the system "bigvax" is "guest", remember to
    notes: delete this message, as it is a bad idea to keep passwords
    message: Do you know the password for bigvax? I forgot what

The example found two files that contained the word, and one file
contained it twice. That was easy, wasn't it? Yes. It is also easy for
someone who has access to your files to find this information out.
*Never* store your passwords in a file on the computer. That is almost
as bad as writing them down on a piece of paper and taping it to your
display.


    Search for uppercase and lower case words
    <https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Grep.html#toc-uh-3>

If any of your files included the words "PASSWORD," or "Password," the
above example would not print them out. When you tell /grep/ to search
for an exact string, it does what it is told. While you could write an
regular expression that includes upper and lower case patterns, /grep/
has a feature for this exact purpose: "-i," or ignore case. That is,

    grep -i password *

would find all variations, including a mixture of upper and lower case
letters.


    Using grep as a filter
    <https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Grep.html#toc-uh-4>

You can have /Grep/ operate on standard input, as well as files
specified on the command line. Of course, if used as a filter, /grep/
does not list the filename, as it doesn't know the name.


    Forcing grep to print a filename
    <https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Grep.html#toc-uh-5>

You may have noticed that when you give /grep/ one filename as an
argument, it does not list the filename. For instance, if you typed

grep password message

the output would be

Do you know the password for bigvax? I forgot what

As you can see, the "message: " was omitted. If you want to force /grep/
to print a filename, always make sure that it is given more than one
file as an argument. This might seem difficult, because if you wanted
two files, you would have specified two files. *U has a simple solution:
use a file that is always there, and always empty. This file is called
//dev/null/. Example:

    grep password message /dev/null

This is very convenient when you are writing shell scripts, and don't
know how many files you will be told to search. Here is a simple script
called /igrep/ that does almost the same as "grep -i," with the
exception taht it always prints the filename:

#!/bin/sh
grep -i "$@" /dev/null

Click here to get file: igrep.sh
<https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Scripts/igrep.sh>


    Showing lines that don't contain a pattern
    <https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Grep.html#toc-uh-6>

A very simple use of /grep/ is to remove lines that contain a pattern.
To remove all lines that contain the work "junk," use the "-v" option:

    grep -v junk

This is typically used as a filter:

    grep -i password * | grep -v junk

I often use it to eliminate excess lines. Suppose I wanted to search for
the word "every," but I don't want "everyone," "everybody," or
"everywhere." I could use the command

    grep every * | grep -v one | grep -v body | grep -v where

This is handy with the C shell command repeat feature. I can execute the
last command, and remove lines that contain certain words:

    !! | grep -v ignorethisword

As an example, when I use /find/ to look for a file, but don't want to
look for backups of the file, I keep adding additional strings to
ignore, especially at the end of the filename:

    find . -print | grep -v '.old$' | grep -v '[%~]$'


    Searching for a hyphen
    <https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Grep.html#toc-uh-7>

Looking for certain strings can be difficult. Suppose you wanted to
search for the combination "-i?" As you can image, typing

    grep -i file

does not work. In fact, /grep/ considers "file" to be the pattern, and
then searches standard input for the word "file." If you type the above
command, it will wait for you to type control-D before it ends, as it is
reading standard input. You see, /grep/ considers the hyphen as an
indication of an option. In a case like this, you must deal with two
problems:

 1. Getting the argument past the shell
 2. Getting the argument into the right form for the command. 

This requires an understanding of the shell quoting functions, as well
as regular expressions. In this case, the hyphen is not s special shell
character, unless it is in square brackets. So the characters "-i" are
ignored by the shell. To put it another way, all four commands below
operate the same way, treating the "-i" as a command line option:

    grep -i *
    grep '-i' *
    grep "-i" *
    grep -i *

However, /grep/ does thing the hyphen is special, so we must get /grep/
to treat it differently. The best way is to create a regular expression
that does not start with a hyphen. As you recall, the "." character, in
regular expressions, matches any character. Therefore the command

    grep .-i *

will match every line containing "-i" except when it is the first
character on a line. Another way to create a regular expression is to
use the square brackets to list the options: "[-]i." Remember that the
hyphen is special in square brackets, except when the first of last
character. However, the shell command

    grep [-]i *

does not work. The square brackets are special to the shell, which will
search for files in the current directory. In this case, the shell will
search for files that match "-i." Either it finds this file, and expands
it to

    grep -i <all the other files>

or it doesn't find this file, and expands it to

    grep <all the other files>

In either case, the action is not what you wanted. Therefore the proper
way to do this is to enclose the regular expression with single
quotation marks, so the pattern is passed to grep unchanged. That is,
the proper command is

    grep '[-]i' *

In general, it is best to quote the regular expression in single quotes,
and then modify the regular expression so the proper pattern is passed
to /grep/.

There is another solution. The special option "-e" means the next
argument is a pattern, and not an option. Therefore

    grep -e -i *

would also work. However, the other solutions work for any command,
which "-e" is a feature of /grep/, and may not be available in other
utilities.

grep -s
grep -l
grep -w

fgrep egrep


    egrep - show lines containing one of several patterns
