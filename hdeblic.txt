    1. Introduction

This document describes a standard, machine-interpretable format for the
|debian/copyright| file. This file is one of the most important files in
Debian packaging, but, prior to this specification, no standard format
was defined for it and its contents varied tremendously across packages.
This made it difficult to automatically extract licensing information.

Use of this specification is optional.

Nothing in this proposal supersedes or modifies any of the requirements
specified in Debian Policy regarding the appropriate detail or
granularity to use when documenting copyright and license status in
|debian/copyright|.


    2. Rationale

The diversity of free software licenses means that Debian needs to care
not only about the freeness of a given work, but also its license's
compatibility with the other parts of Debian it uses.

The arrival of the GPL version 3, its incompatibility with version 2,
and our inability to spot the software where the incompatibility might
be problematic is one prominent occurrence of this limitation.

There are earlier precedents, also. One is the GPL/OpenSSL
incompatibility. Apart from grepping |debian/copyright|, which is prone
to numerous false positives (packaging under the GPL but software under
another license) or negatives (GPL software but with an “OpenSSL special
exception” dual licensing form), there is no reliable way to know which
software in Debian might be problematic.

And there is more to come. There are issues with shipping GPLv2-only
software with a CDDL operating system such as Nexenta. The GPL version 3
solves this issue, but not all GPL software can switch to it and we have
no way to know how much of Debian should be stripped from such a system.

Even where licenses are DFSG-free and mutually compatible, users may
wish for a way to identify software under certain licenses (if, for
example, they have special reasons to avoid certain licenses).


    3. Acknowledgements

Many people have worked on this specification over the years. The
following alphabetical list is incomplete; please suggest missing
people: Russ Allbery, Ben Finney, Sam Hocevar, Steve Langasek, Charles
Plessy, Noah Slater, Jonas Smedegaard, Lars Wirzenius.


    4. File syntax

The |debian/copyright| file must be machine-interpretable, yet
human-readable, while communicating all mandated upstream information,
copyright notices and licensing details.

The syntax of the file is the same as for other Debian control files, as
specified in the Debian Policy Manual. See its section 5.1
<https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields#s-controlsyntax>
for details. Extra fields can be added to any paragraph. No prefixing is
necessary or desired, but please avoid names similar to standard ones so
that mistakes are easier to catch. Future versions of the
|debian/copyright| specification will attempt to avoid conflicting
specifications for widely used extra fields.

The file consists of two or more paragraphs. At minimum, the file must
include one header paragraph <#header-paragraph> and one Files paragraph
<#files-paragraph>.

There are four types of fields. The definition for each field in this
document indicates which type of value it takes.


      4.1. Single-line values

The entire value of a single-line field must be on a single line. For
example, the |Format| field has a single-line value specifying the
version of the machine-readable format that is used.


      4.2. Whitespace-separated lists

Field values defined as whitespace-separated lists may be on one line or
many. Values in the list are separated by one or more whitespace
characters (space, tab, or newline). For example, the |Files| field
contains a whitespace-separated list of filename patterns.


      4.3. Line-based lists

Line-based lists have one value per line. For example, the
|Upstream-Contact| field contains a line-based list of contact addresses.


      4.4. Formatted text

Formatted text fields use the same rules as the long description in a
package's |Description| field in Debian control files.

In some but not all cases, the first line may have special meaning as a
synopsis, similar to how the |Description| field uses the first line for
the short description. See Debian Policy's section 5.6.13, “Description”
<https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields#s-f-Description>,
for details. For example, |Disclaimer| is a formatted text field that
has no special first line, and |License| is a formatted text field where
the first line indicates the short name or names of the licenses.


    5. Paragraphs

There are three kinds of paragraphs. The first paragraph in the file is
called the header paragraph <#header-paragraph>. Every other paragraph
is either a Files paragraph <#files-paragraph> or a stand-alone License
paragraph <#stand-alone-license-paragraph>. This is similar to source
and binary package paragraphs in |debian/control| files.


      5.1. Header paragraph (once)

The following fields may be present in a header paragraph.

  *

    Format <#format-field>: required.

  *

    Upstream-Name <#upstream-name-field>: optional.

  *

    Upstream-Contact <#upstream-contact-field>: optional.

  *

    Source <#source-field>: optional.

  *

    Disclaimer <#disclaimer-field>: optional.

  *

    Comment <#comment-field>: optional.

  *

    License <#license-field>: optional.

  *

    Copyright <#copyright-field>: optional.

The |Copyright| and |License| fields in the /header paragraph/ may
complement but do not replace the fields in the /Files paragraphs/. If
present, they summarise the copyright notices or redistribution terms
for the package as a whole.

For example, when a work has a grant of license under both a permissive
and a copyleft license, |License| can be used to clarify the license
terms for the combination. |Copyright| and |License| together can also
be used to document a /compilation copyright/ and license.

It is valid to use |License| in the header paragraph without an
accompanying |Copyright| field, but |Copyright| alone is not sufficient.


        5.1.1. Example header paragraph

Format: https://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/copyright-format/1.0/
Upstream-Name: SOFTware
Upstream-Contact: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
Source: https://www.example.com/software/project


      5.2. Files paragraph (repeatable)

The declaration of copyright and license for files may consist of one or
more paragraphs. In the simplest case, a single paragraph with |Files:
*| can be used to state the license and copyright for the whole package.
Only the license and copyright information required by the Debian
archive is required to be listed here.

The following fields may be present in a Files paragraph.

  *

    Files <#files-field>: required.

  *

    Copyright <#copyright-field>: required.

  *

    License <#license-field>: required.

  *

    Comment <#comment-field>: optional.


        5.2.1. Example files paragraphs

Files: *
Copyright: 1975-2010 Ulla Upstream
License: GPL-2+

Files: debian/*
Copyright: 2010 Daniela Debianizer
License: GPL-2+

Files: debian/patches/fancy-feature
Copyright: 2010 Daniela Debianizer
License: GPL-3+

Files: */*.1
Copyright: 2010 Manuela Manpager
License: GPL-2+

In this example, copyright in all files is held by the upstream, and
that copyright holder grants license under the GPL, version 2 or later.
There are three exceptions. All the Debian packaging files have
copyright held by the packager, and further one specific file providing
a new feature has a different grant of license. Finally, there are some
manual pages added to the package, with copyright held by a third person.

Since the license of the manual pages is the same as most other files in
the package, the final paragraph above could instead be combined with
the first paragraph, listing both copyright statements in one
|Copyright| field. Whether to combine paragraphs with the same grant of
license is left to the discretion of the author of the
|debian/copyright| file.


      5.3. Stand-alone License Paragraph (optional, repeatable)

Stand-alone |License| paragraphs can be used to provide the full license
text for a given license once, instead of repeating it in each |Files|
paragraph that refers to it.

The synopsis (on the first line) of the |License| field must be a single
license short name or a short name followed by a license exception.

The following fields may be present in a stand-alone License paragraph.

  *

    License <#license-field>: required.

  *

    Comment <#comment-field>: optional.

*Example 1. tri-licensed files*

    6. Fields

The following fields are defined for use in |debian/copyright|.


      6.1. |Format|

Single-line: URI of the format specification. The field that should be
used for the current version of this document is:

Format: https://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/copyright-format/1.0/

The original version of this specification used the non-https version of
this URL as its URI, namely:

Format: http://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/copyright-format/1.0/

Both versions are valid and refer to the same specification, and parsers
should interpret both as referencing the same format. The https URI is
preferred.


      6.2. |Upstream-Name|

Single-line: the name upstream uses for the software


      6.3. |Upstream-Contact|

Line-based list: the preferred address(es) to reach the upstream
project. May be free-form text, but by convention will usually be
written as a list of RFC5322 addresses or URIs.


      6.4. |Source|

Formatted text, no synopsis: an explanation of where the upstream source
came from. Typically this would be a URL, but it might be a free-form
explanation. The Debian Policy section 12.5
<https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-docs#s-copyrightfile>
requires this information unless there are no upstream sources, which is
mainly the case for native Debian packages. If the upstream source has
been modified to remove non-free parts, that should be explained in this
field.


      6.5. |Disclaimer|

Formatted text, no synopsis: this field is used for non-free or contrib
packages to state that they are not part of Debian and to explain why
(see Debian Policy section 12.5
<https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-docs#s-copyrightfile>).


      6.6. |Comment|

Formatted text, no synopsis: this field can provide additional
information. For example, it might quote an e-mail from upstream
justifying why the license is acceptable to the main archive, or an
explanation of how this version of the package has been forked from a
version known to be DFSG-free, even though the current upstream version
is not.


      6.7. |License|

Formatted text, with synopsis.

In the header paragraph <#header-paragraph>, this field gives the
license information for the package as a whole, which may be different
or simplified from a combination of all the per-file license
information. In a Files paragraph <#files-paragraph>, this field gives
the licensing terms for the files listed in the |Files| field for this
paragraph. In a stand-alone License paragraph
<#stand-alone-license-paragraph>, it gives the licensing terms for those
paragraphs which reference it.

First line (synopsis): an abbreviated name for the license, or
expression giving alternatives (see the Short name <#license-short-name>
section for a list of standard abbreviations). If there are licenses
present in the package without a standard short name, an arbitrary short
name may be assigned for these licenses. These arbitrary names are only
guaranteed to be unique within a single copyright file.

If there are no remaining lines, then all of the short names or short
names followed by license exceptions in the synopsis must be described
in stand-alone License paragraphs <#stand-alone-license-paragraph>.
Otherwise, this field should either include the full text of the
license(s) or include a pointer to the license file under
|/usr/share/common-licenses|. This field should include all text needed
in order to fulfill both Debian Policy's requirement for including a
copy of the software's distribution license (12.5
<https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-docs#s-copyrightfile>), and
any license requirements to include warranty disclaimers or other
notices with the binary package.


      6.8. |Copyright|

Formatted text, no synopsis: one or more free-form copyright statements.
Any formatting is permitted; see the examples below for some ideas for
how to structure the field to make it easier to read. In the header
paragraph, this field gives the copyright information for the package as
a whole, which may be different or simplified from a combination of all
the per-file copyright information. In the Files paragraphs, it gives
the copyright information that applies to the files matched by the
|Files| pattern. If a work has no copyright holder (i.e., it is in the
public domain), that information should be recorded here.

The |Copyright| field collects all relevant copyright notices for the
files of this paragraph. Not all copyright notices may apply to every
individual file, and years of publication for one copyright holder may
be gathered together. For example, if file A has:

Copyright 2008 John Smith
Copyright 2009 Angela Watts

and file B has:

Copyright 2010 Angela Watts

a single paragraph may still be used for both files. The |Copyright|
field for that paragraph would contain:

Copyright 2008 John Smith
Copyright 2009, 2010 Angela Watts

The |Copyright| field may contain the original copyright statement
copied exactly (including the word “Copyright”), or it may shorten the
text or merge it with other copyright statements as described above, as
long as it does not sacrifice information. Examples in this
specification use both forms.


      6.9. |Files|

Whitespace-separated list: list of patterns indicating files covered by
the license and copyright specified in this paragraph.

Filename patterns in the |Files| field are specified using a simplified
shell glob syntax. Patterns are separated by whitespace.

  *

    Only the wildcards |*| and |?| apply; the former matches any number
    of characters (including none), the latter a single character. Both
    match slashes (|/|) and leading dots, unlike shell globs. The
    pattern |*.in| therefore matches any file whose name ends in |.in|
    anywhere in the source tree, not just at the top level.

  *

    Patterns match pathnames that start at the root of the source tree.
    Thus, “|Makefile.in|” matches only the file at the root of the tree,
    but “|*/Makefile.in|” matches at any depth.

  *

    The backslash (|\|) is used to remove the magic from the next
    character; see table below.

Escape sequence	Matches
|\*|	star (asterisk)
|\?|	question mark
|\\|	backslash

Any other character following a backslash is an error.

This is the same pattern syntax as fnmatch(3) without the |FNM_PATHNAME|
flag, or the argument to the |-path| test of the GNU *find* command,
except that |[]| wildcards are not recognized.

Multiple |Files| paragraphs are allowed. The last paragraph that matches
a particular file applies to it. More general paragraphs should
therefore be given first, followed by more specific overrides.

Exclusions are only supported by adding |Files| paragraphs to override
the previous match.

This syntax does not distinguish file names from directory names; a
trailing slash in a pattern will never match any actual path. A whole
directory tree may be selected with a pattern like "foo/*".

The space character, used to separate patterns, cannot be escaped with a
backslash. A path like "foo bar" may be selected with a pattern like
"foo?bar".


    7. License specification


      7.1. Short name

Much of the value of a machine-parseable copyright file lies in being
able to correlate the licenses of multiple pieces of software. To that
end, this spec defines standard short names for a number of commonly
used licenses, which can be used in the synopsis (first line) of a
|License| field.

These short names have the specified meanings across all uses of this
file format, and /must not/ be used to refer to any other licenses.
Parsers may thus rely on these short names referring to the same
licenses wherever they occur, without needing to parse or compare the
full license text.

From time to time, licenses may be added to or removed from the list of
standard short names. Such changes in the list of short names will
always be accompanied by changes to the version of this standard and to
the recommended |Format| value. Implementers who are parsing copyright
files should take care not to assume anything about the meaning of
license short names for unknown |Format| versions.

Use of a standard short name does not override the Debian Policy
requirement to include the full license text in |debian/copyright|, nor
any requirements in the license of the work regarding reproduction of
legal notices. This information must still be included in the |License|
field, either in a stand-alone License paragraph or in the relevant
files paragraph.

For licenses that have multiple versions in use, the short name is
formed from the general short name of the license family, followed by a
dash and the version number. If the version number is omitted, the
lowest version number is implied. When the license grant permits using
the terms of any later version of that license, add a plus sign to the
end of the short name. For example, the short name |GPL| refers to the
GPL version 1 and is equivalent to |GPL-1|, although the latter is
clearer and therefore preferred. If the package may be distributed under
the GPL version 1 or any later version, use a short name of |GPL-1+|.

For SPDX <#spdx> compatibility, versions with trailing /dot-zeroes/ are
considered to be equivalent to versions without (e.g., “2.0.0” is
considered equal to “2.0” and “2”).

Currently, the full text of the licenses is only available in the SPDX
Open Source License Registry <https://spdx.org/licenses>.

An exception or clarification to a license is signalled in plain text,
by appending |with |/|keywords|/| exception| to the short name. This
document provides a list of keywords that must be used when referring to
the most frequent exceptions. When exceptions other than these are in
effect that modify a common license by granting additional permissions,
you may use an arbitrary keyword not taken from the below list of
keywords. When a license differs from a common license because of added
restrictions rather than because of added permissions, a distinct short
name should be used instead of |with |/|keywords|/| exception|.

Only one exception may be specified for each license within a given
license specification. If more than one exception applies to a single
license, an arbitrary short name indicating that combination of multiple
exceptions must be used instead.

The GPL |Font| exception refers to the text added to the license notice
of each file as specified at How does the GPL apply to fonts
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq#FontException>. The precise text
corresponding to this exception is:

As a special exception, if you create a document which uses this font,
and embed this font or unaltered portions of this font into the
document, this font does not by itself cause the resulting document to
be covered by the GNU General Public License. This exception does not
however invalidate any other reasons why the document might be covered
by the GNU General Public License. If you modify this font, you may
extend this exception to your version of the font, but you are not
obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception
statement from your version.

The GPL |OpenSSL| exception gives permission to link GPL-licensed code
with the OpenSSL library, which contains GPL-incompatible clauses. For
more information, see The OpenSSL License and The GPL
<https://www.gnome.org/~markmc/openssl-and-the-gpl> by Mark McLoughlin
and the message middleman software license conflicts with OpenSSL
<https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/05/msg00595.html> by Mark
McLoughlin on the /debian-legal/ mailing list. The text corresponding to
this exception is:

In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holders give
permission to link the code of portions of this program with the
OpenSSL library under certain conditions as described in each
individual source file, and distribute linked combinations including
the two.

You must obey the GNU General Public License in all respects for all
of the code used other than OpenSSL. If you modify file(s) with this
exception, you may extend this exception to your version of the
file(s), but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do
so, delete this exception statement from your version. If you delete
this exception statement from all source files in the program, then
also delete it here.


        7.1.1. Public domain

The |License| short name |public-domain| does not refer to a set of
license terms. There are some works which are not subject to copyright
in any jurisdiction and therefore no license is required for any purpose
covered by copyright law. This short name is an explicit declaration
that the associated files are “in the public domain”.

Widespread misunderstanding about copyright in general, and the public
domain in particular, results in the common assertion that a work is in
the public domain when this is partly or wholly untrue for that work.
The Wikipedia article on public domain
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain> is a useful reference for
this subject.

When the |License| field in a paragraph has the short name
|public-domain|, the remaining lines of the field /must/ explain exactly
what exemption the corresponding files for that paragraph have from
default copyright restrictions.


      7.2. Syntax

License names are case-insensitive, and may not contain spaces.

In case of multi-licensing, the license short names are separated by
|or| when the user can chose between different licenses, and by |and|
when use of the work must simultaneously comply with the terms of
multiple licenses.

For instance, this is a simple, “GPL version 2 or later” field:

License: GPL-2+

This is a dual-licensed GPL/Artistic work such as Perl:

License: GPL-1+ or Artistic

This is for a file that has both GPL and classic BSD code in it:

License: GPL-2+ and BSD-3-clause

For the most complex cases, a comma is used to disambiguate the priority
of |or|s and |and|s. The conjunction “|and|” has priority over “|or|”
unless preceded by a comma. For instance:

|A or B and C| means |A or (B and C)|.

|A or B, and C| means |(A or B) and C|.

This is for a file that has Perl code and classic BSD code in it:

License: GPL-2+ or Artistic-2.0, and BSD-3-clause

A |GPL-2+| work with the |OpenSSL| exception is in effect a
dual-licensed work that can be redistributed either under the |GPL-2+|,
or under the |GPL-2+| with the |OpenSSL| exception. It is thus expressed
as |GPL-2+ with OpenSSL exception|. A possible |License| field for such
a license is:

License: GPL-2+ with OpenSSL exception

 and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public
 License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
 version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later
 version.
 .
 In addition, as a special exception, the author of this
 program gives permission to link the code of its
 release with the OpenSSL project's "OpenSSL" library (or
 with modified versions of it that use the same license as
 the "OpenSSL" library), and distribute the linked
 executables. You must obey the GNU General Public
 License in all respects for all of the code used other
 than "OpenSSL".  If you modify this file, you may extend
 this exception to your version of the file, but you are
 not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do so,
 delete this exception statement from your version.

      7.3. SPDX

SPDX <https://spdx.org/> is an attempt to standardize a format for
communicating the components, licenses and copyrights associated with a
software package. It and the machine-readable |debian/copyright| format
attempt to be somewhat compatible. However, the two formats have
different aims, and so the formats are different. The DEP5 wiki page
<https://wiki.debian.org/Proposals/CopyrightFormat> will be used to
track the differences.
