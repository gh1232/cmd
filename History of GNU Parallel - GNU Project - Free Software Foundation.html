    History of GNU Parallel

------------------------------------------------------------------------

GNU *parallel* was originally two tools: *xxargs* and *parallel*.

*xxargs* was a tool that had the most basic features of *xargs* namely
-0, -n, -x, and {}. In addition it also had -1 which is called
*--halt-on-error 1* in GNU *parallel*. *xxargs* was developed during
2002-2005 and was based on work by Cameron Simpson. Cameron sums up the
reason for developing *xxargs* very well in a posting from 2001-12-20:

    Having pretty much had it with xargs, which is a busted piece of
    crap due to its quoting/whitespace problems, here is a less featured
    but more robust one. - Cameron Simpson <cs@zip.com.au>

*parallel* dates back to around the same time. It was originally a
wrapper that generated a makefile and used *make -j* to do the
parallelization. The only usage was: *cat commandlines | parallel number*.

The full(!) source code of the very first version of Parallel dated
2002-01-06:

  #!/usr/bin/perl

  $processes=shift;

  chomp(@jobs=<>);
  for (@jobs) {
      $jobnr++;
      push @makefile,
      (".PHONY : job$jobnr\n",
       "job$jobnr :\n",
       "\t$_\n");
  }
  unshift @makefile, "all : ",(map { "job$_ " } 1 .. $jobnr),"\n";
  
  open (MAKE, "| make -k -f - -j $processes") || die;
  print MAKE @makefile;
  close MAKE;

It did not support grouping of output or running jobs on multiple
computers, and the most common reason for bugs was quoting the string
incorrectly in the Makefile. It also stressed *make*'s dependency
calculation: at this time *make*'s initialization would take O(n^2) time
on n independant targets, which was a real problem if you had 1000000
commandlines to run. A later version chopped the commandlines up into
blocks of 5000 lines to minimize the problem.

In 2005 it occurred to me that I often used *xxargs* and *parallel*
together and I saw no reason why they could not merge into a single
tool. The single tool was called *parallel* and the development of
*xxargs* stopped. At this point both *xxargs* and *parallel* were used
in production.

GNU *parallel* thus did not have one but two main objectives: replace
*xargs* and run commands in parallel.

In the years after 2005 I noticed that other people still had problems
with *xargs*' treatment of quotes and whitespace, so I tried getting
*parallel* accepted into GNU findutils. It was not accepted as it was
written in Perl and the team did not want GNU findutils to depend on Perl.

In 2007 unittests were added to *parallel* to make sure old problems
would not creep back in while developing new features. The hosting was
moved to git hosted on savannah.nongnu.org.

In February 2009 I tried getting *parallel* added to the package
moreutils. The author never replied to the email or the two reminders,
but in June 2009 moreutils chose to add another program called parallel.
This choice leads to some confusion even today.

In 2010 *parallel* was adopted as an official GNU tool and the name was
changed to GNU *parallel*. As GNU already had a tool for running jobs on
remote computers (called *pexec*) it was a hard decision to include GNU
*parallel* as well. I believe the decision was mostly based on GNU
*parallel* having a more familiar user interface - behaving very much
like *xargs*. Shortly after the release as GNU tool remote execution was
added and all missing options from *xargs* were added to make it
possible to use GNU *parallel* as a drop in replacement for *xargs*.

Copenhagen, 2010-11-20, Ole Tange, Author of GNU Parallel (Source code
added 2021-03-06).
