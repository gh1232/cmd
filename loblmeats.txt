And they are easy to cook to thick and juicy perfection. Keep some in the freezer and you’ll have sizzling hot burgers in no time. We didn’t invent burgers.

Steak enthusiasts and burger aficionados, take note: we’ve combined two barbecue favourites, sirloin and beef burgers, in one meaty, beautifully seasoned burger. Because we know you’ve been looking for something a little different and a whole lot delicious. Sirgers. Burgloins. Whatever you call them, these thick and juicy sirloin burgers are a whole new level of steak-and-burger adoration. As for toppers, you could go the steakhouse menu route, adding steak sauce and fried mushrooms. Or keep it old school with traditional condiments. As for the name? We’ll leave it as is.

Lean Beef Burgers
2.27 kg
$25.99ea

    $1.14/ 100g

Get this item with your grocery order.

Rocking the backyard barbecue is what you do best. But sometimes, you want to lighten things up a smidge, without giving up any flavour. Our meaty burgers are made with perfectly seasoned lean beef yet have 45% less fat than PC® Thick & JuicyÔ Beef Burgers. It’s impressive how great these taste, and chances are, no one will notice any difference from regular fat burgers. Dress them to impress, with fresh or pickled vegetables, salsa – whatever moves you. Hot off the grill, the great taste of our thick and juicy burgers will still shine through, no matter how they’re topped.

Ribeye Is the King of Steaks for Taste and Nutrition

Juicy.
Paul KitaPublished: Jan 13, 2015
preview for Michael B Jordan | Train Like A Celeb

If you're ever had a great steak—like a life-changing, memory-searing, soul-satisfying steak—it was likely a ribeye steak.

Now, of course, T-bones and filet mignon and any host of other steak cuts can (and often are) taste incredible. But there's something truly special, truly magical about the nature of ribeye.

Butchers cut ribeye steaks from the rib section of the cow, which runs the shoulder of the animal to its loin. The rib section contains meat that is rich with intramuscular fat, which—SURPRISE—is why steaks from this section taste so amazing.

Although ribeye steaks tend to contain more fat than, say, that filet mignon, they also possess an almost buttery flavor and texture.

Does this fat mean that you shouldn't eat ribeye steak? Heck no. Ribeye is loaded with muscle-building protein, strength-stoking creatine, blood-aiding iron, energy-maintaining vitamin B12, and a good handful of other vitamins and minerals.

And that’s just on a nutritional level. There’s also the fact that ribeye steaks are durable steaks. Unlike leaner cuts of beef, ribeye steaks can take a little more heat due to the protection offered by the intramuscular fat.

That means ribeye steaks are great for high-heat grilling, broiling, and pan-searing. And while it’s possible to over- or under-cook a ribeye steak, it’s far less difficult to do so.

Plus, there’s the look of the thing. Whether you buy your ribeye steak bone-in or boneless, it looks formidable on the plate sliced and served ready to eat—substantive, striking, and impossible to resist.

Nutritional Value of a Ribeye Steak

    Comparison

Written by Sandi Busch
08 July, 2011

According to FoodReference.com, rib eye is one of the top five favorite beef entrées 2. It’s an expensive cut of meat but also one that’s tender, juicy and filled with flavor. This favorite steak is an excellent source of complete protein, zinc, selenium, phosphorus, niacin, and vitamins B6 and B12.
Definition

A rib eye steak comes from the large end of the beef rib (near the shoulder). Rib eyes are usually boneless but may be bone-in. It is well-marbled, with bits of fat interspersed in the muscle that give the steak it's flavor and tenderness. The quality of beef is graded according to the amount of marbling. A rib eye that has abundant marbling is "prime" and "choice" rib eyes contain a moderate amount of marbling.

    A rib eye steak comes from the large end of the beef rib (near the shoulder).
    A rib eye that has abundant marbling is "prime" and "choice" rib eyes contain a moderate amount of marbling.

Basic Nutrition

Nutrition information is based upon the USDA nutrient database as provided by NutritionData.com for a 3-oz. serving of broiled choice rib eye 1. One serving contains 174 calories and 25 grams of protein, which represents 49 percent of the recommended daily value (DV) based on a 2,000 calorie a day diet. Rib eye doesn’t have any carbohydrates or dietary fiber.
Fats

A 3-oz. choice cut of rib eye contains a total fat content of 8 g. It has 77.3 mg of cholesterol and 2.9 g of saturated fat. Rib eye also provides healthier fats. It has 3.1 g of monounsaturated fats, 0.3 g of polyunsaturated fats, 22.1 mg of omega-3 and 223 mg of omega-6 fatty acids.

    choice cut of rib eye contains a total fat content of 8 g. It has 77.3 mg of cholesterol and 2.9 g of saturated fat.

Vitamins

Rib eye provides all of the B vitamins but is especially high in niacin (7.2 mg), vitamin B6 (0.5 mg) and vitamin B12 (1.5 micrograms), which represents 25 to 36 percent of the recommended daily value for these nutrients in a 3-oz. portion. You’ll also receive between 2 and 7 percent of the recommended daily value of vitamin E (0.3 mg), folate (8.5 mcg), pantothenic acid (0.5 mg), riboflavin (0.1 mg) and thiamin (0.1 mg).
Minerals

According to information from NutritionData.com, rib eye is especially high in selenium (28.6 mcg or 41 percent DV), zinc (4.7 mg or 31 percent DV) and phosphorus (193 mg or 19 percent DV). You’ll also receive between 1 to 9 percent of the recommended daily value of calcium (13.6 mg), iron (1.7 mg), magnesium (21.2 mg) and copper (0.1 mg). One serving supplies 51 mg of sodium, which sounds high but is only 2 percent of the recommended daily value.

    According to information from NutritionData.com, rib eye is especially high in selenium (28.6 mcg or 41 percent DV), zinc (4.7 mg or 31 percent DV) and phosphorus (193 mg or 19 percent DV).

Comparison

Prime cuts of rib eye are more expensive and sold primarily to restaurants because they have more marbling. While the additional marbling results in steaks that are even more tender and tasty, it also has an impact on calories and fat content. Nutrition facts provided by Wegmans.com state that a 3-oz. serving of prime rib eye has 250 calories, which is 76 more than the choice cut. Total fat is 18 g, or 10 g higher than choice and saturated fat is 8 g (compared to 2.9 g of saturated fat in the choice cut).

How to Reduce Eye Redness
Written by Anna Aronson

Fact Checked

Your eyes become red or bloodshot from the blood vessels on the surface of the eyes getting irritated and enlarged. Many factors can contribute to red eyes, including dust or foreign bodies in the eye, allergies and eye injuries. Some eye infections -- including conjunctivitis and blepharitis -- can also cause eye redness, according to MedLinePlus 1. Most cases of eye redness can easily be treated at home, but if your vision is affected or you are experiencing pain you should seek medical attention 1.
Is This an Emergency?

If you are experiencing serious medical symptoms, seek emergency treatment immediately.

Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water. When your eyes are red and irritated, you're likely to instinctively touch or rub them. Because of this, it's a good idea to wash your hands frequently throughout the day. This can be especially helpful if you have an eye infection that spreads easily.

Lie down in a comfortable place.

Place cool compresses over your eye or eyes. If the compresses are too cold, try wrapping them in a cloth or towel.

Lay with the compresses over your eyes for between five and 10 minutes.

Repeat these procedures throughout the day when your eyes become irritated or uncomfortable.
Tips

Eye drops available over the counter at drugstores can also help reduce redness in the eye. Some eye drops are designed specifically for this purpose.

Try not to rub or scratch your eyes. This can cause the redness to worsen and can also contribute to the spread of an infection.

If you do not have any cool compresses handy, try using a bag of frozen vegetables such as peas or corn. The small size of peas and corn makes them ideal for use as an ice pack or cool compress.

Warnings

If your eye is infected, do not wear contact lenses or apply eye makeup until the infection has cleared completely, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center.
